# Financial News Bot

A multi-agent system for real-time US financial market analysis and distribution.

**Internship Assessment Project for CrowdWisdomTrading**

---

## Overview

This project implements a 5-agent system that automatically gathers US financial news, creates structured summaries, and distributes them across multiple languages via Telegram. Built as part of my internship assessment to demonstrate multi-agent architecture, API integration, and financial data processing skills.

**Problem Solved**: Automated financial news aggregation and multi-language distribution for global trading audiences.

---

## Architecture

The system consists of 5 specialized agents working in sequence:

```
Search Agent â†’ Summary Agent â†’ Formatting Agent â†’ Translation Agent â†’ Telegram Agent
```

### Agent Responsibilities

## Development Process

### My Approach
As a fresher, I approached this challenge by:

1. **Breaking Down Requirements**: Analyzed the 5-agent specification systematically
2. **API Research**: Evaluated different financial data sources for reliability
3. **Modular Design**: Created separate agents with single responsibilities
4. **Iterative Testing**: Tested each component individually before integration
5. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error management for production readiness

### Technical Decisions
- **Direct API Calls**: Chose direct HTTP requests over wrapper libraries for reliability
- **Multi-Source Search**: Combined Tavily and Serper for comprehensive news coverage
- **Groq Integration**: Selected for free tier availability and financial analysis capability
- **Telegram Distribution**: Used HTTP API for consistent message delivery

### Challenges Overcome
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Resolved CrewAI package conflicts with direct API integration
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented smart delays and fallback mechanisms
- **Multi-Language Accuracy**: Developed fallback system for translation reliability
- **Content Formatting**: Created mobile-optimized HTML for Telegram compatibility
