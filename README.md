ðŸ“ˆ Financial News Aggregator
Multi-Agent System for Real-Time Market Analysis

Built as part of my internship assessment for CrowdWisdomTrading. This project demonstrates my understanding of multi-agent systems, financial APIs, and automated content distribution.

 Project Overview
I developed a Python-based system that automates financial news analysis using a multi-agent approach. The system searches for real-time US market data, creates summaries, and distributes them across multiple languages.
Key Challenge Solved: How to efficiently process and distribute financial information across multiple languages while maintaining accuracy and timeliness.
ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
Agent Architecture
I designed 5 specialized agents, each handling a specific part of the workflow:

News Search: Aggregates data from multiple financial sources
Analysis: Creates structured market summaries
Content Format: Applies professional formatting
Translation: Handles multi-language conversion
Distribution: Manages Telegram channel posting

Technology Stack

Backend: Python 3.11
APIs: Groq (LLM), Tavily (News), Serper (Search), Telegram (Distribution)
Architecture: Event-driven multi-agent system
Data Processing: JSON parsing, content filtering, rate limiting

 Development Process
Problem Analysis
As a fresher approaching this challenge, I broke down the requirements:

Need real-time financial data from multiple sources
Must create readable summaries for different audiences
Require multi-language support for global reach
Need reliable distribution mechanism

Solution Design
I chose a modular agent approach because:

Each agent has a single responsibility (easier to debug)
Scalable architecture (can add more agents later)
Clear separation of concerns (search vs analysis vs distribution)
Fault tolerance (if one agent fails, others continue)

Implementation Challenges & Solutions
Challenge 1: API Rate Limits

Solution: Implemented smart rate limiting and retry logic
Added fallback mechanisms for API failures

Challenge 2: Multi-Language Accuracy

Solution: Used financial terminology dictionaries
Preserved numerical data across translations

Challenge 3: Content Formatting

Solution: HTML template system for consistent presentation
Mobile-optimized layout for Telegram

 Results & Impact
Performance Metrics

Data Sources: 40+ financial news sources per run
Processing Time: ~60-90 seconds end-to-end
Accuracy: 99%+ uptime with error handling
Languages: 4 languages with financial terminology preservation

Sample Output Quality
The system generates professional summaries that include:

Market index performance with percentage changes
Key financial headlines with impact analysis
Notable stock movements with reasoning
Forward-looking market catalysts
